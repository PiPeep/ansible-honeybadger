Updating Honeybadger
====================

In general, updating should be as easy as running

```
git pull
./autosetup --no-config
```

In case it's not, we'll update this document with what you need to do to get
from revision A to revision B. **Check this document first** before updating
your Honeybadger install.

We hope to script this in the future to have an easier update process, akin to
`autosetup`.
