      <h1>Honeybadger Server</h1>
    </header>

    This server is configured using
    <a href="https://github.com/pipeep/ansible-honeybadger">ansible-honeybadger</a>,
    with the following services enabled:

    <ul>
      {% if tor %}<li>tor{% endif %}
      {% if bitcoind %}<li>bitcoind{% endif %}
    </ul>

    {% if tor %}
    <h1 id="tor">What is Tor?</h1>
    <p>
      Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against
      traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal
      freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships,
      and state security.

    {% endif %}

    {% if bitcoind %}
    <h1 id="bitcoind">What is Bitcoin?</h1>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority
      or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out
      collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public,
      nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and
      <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/support-bitcoin">
        everyone can take part
      </a>. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses
      that could not be covered by any previous payment system.
    </p>
