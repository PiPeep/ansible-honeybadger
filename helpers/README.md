Helper Scripts
==============

These scripts are used by autosetup, and may be used alone, but keep in mind
that some are designed to place files into or read from the CWD. You should be
in the top-level honeybadger directory when running the scripts, not this
directory.

They may not be well documented, but they should support a `--help` argument.
